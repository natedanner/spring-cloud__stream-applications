= Stream Applications Integration Tests

This contains integration tests for pre-packaged stream-applications for Docker using https://www.testcontainers.org/[TestContainers].
These are end-to-end integration tests running apps and required resources, using docker-compose.
The goal is to have an end-to-end integration test for each pre-packaged application.
We don't aim to test all different configuration options, as this is the responsibility of the stream application and function components.
One of the major benefits is to verify the built Docker images run correctly, especially when we introduce global changes,
such as upgrading the base JDK image, the maven plugins, or other pervasive changes.

== Test Strategy

See https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/tree/master/applications/stream-applications-core/common/stream-applications-test-support[] for a full description.


The tests use following patterns:

== Source
To test a source, we may require some application specific setup or event to trigger the source.
For example, the jdbc source needs some data in the database to which it is listening.
Then use an `OutputMatcher` to verify the output.

== Sink
To test a sink, we need to publish a message to its input. Simply use the provided TestTopicSender.
Then we need to verify the result by checking the sink's external resource.

== Processor
To test a processor we publish a message and  use an `OutputMatcher`  to verify the output.

== Configuration
See link:src/test/java/org/springframework/cloud/stream/app/integration/test/common/Configuration.java[Configuration] for configuration
options. These tests use Spring but not boot currently.
The most important setting is the image versions to test.
To override it, set the System property, e.g.,

./mvnw clean test -Dspring.cloud.stream.applications.version=5.0.0-RC1
